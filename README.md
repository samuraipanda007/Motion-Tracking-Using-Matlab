# Motion-Tracking-Using-Matlab
my class final assignment using matlab

We were tasked to create a motion tracking sistem using matlab to detect an object moving in a 2 second video. We made the videos ourselves and made the codes for it. There are stll a lot of improvemenst to make sure this code can run on any situation but at this time its enough for my video. The object that is tracked would be boxed an a vecktor plot would be used to display its speed an overall direction.
